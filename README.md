# Solstice


This is a mod for **The Long Dark** by Hinterland Games, Inc.


It introduces changes to the length of the day over time, resulting in a summer solstice ("longest day") and winter solstice ("shortest day"). This will have also have an effect on how bright and cold it is.

The changes are only available in custom mode and the length and starting point in the cycle can be configured.
